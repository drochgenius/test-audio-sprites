00:00:00 --> 00:00:02.432
You already know that when you add, 

00:00:02.432 --> 00:00:04.392
you put two groups together. 

00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:06.769
3 plus 2 equals 5.  

00:00:06.77 --> 00:00:08.713
The commutative property tells us 

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:11.342
that we can switch the order of the addends.  

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:12.834
2 plus 3 equals 5. 

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:16.599
[pause] We can make two more addition equations 

00:00:16.6 --> 00:00:18.724
We can start with the total 5â€¦ 

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:21.407
and place the addends to the right. [pause] 

00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:24.88
Now letâ€™s look at the subtraction equations we can write 

00:00:24.88 --> 00:00:26.465
with these same numbers.  

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:30.807
When you subtract, you take one group from another. 

00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:32.143
5 minus 2 is 3. 

00:00:32.143 --> 00:00:32.226
 

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:35.395
Or we could say 3 equals 5 minus 2.  

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:37.808
We could also take away 3.  

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.257
5 minus 3 equals 2.  

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:43.354
Or, 2 equals 5 minus 3.  

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:47.021
When one operation undoes another we call those operations

00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:47.464
inverse

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:51.383
operations. Addition and subtraction are inverse operations.  

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.274
A break apart drawing models the relationship between numbers. 

00:00:55.274 --> 00:00:59.165
The drawing can help you write related addition and subtraction

00:00:59.165 --> 00:00:59.844
equations. 

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:03.492
This drawing models how 2, 3, and 5 are related. 

00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:07.585
All eight equations can be modeled with this drawing.  

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:10.826
They each have the total 5 . . . 

00:01:10.827 --> 00:01:12.087
the addend 3â€¦ 

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:13.636
and the addend 2.
