00:00:00 --> 00:00:03.971
Elias made a pitcher of lemonade to sell to his friends.  

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:07.603
He charges one dollar for each cup of lemonade.  

00:00:07.604 --> 00:00:11.832
His first customer wants to pay for the lemonade 

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:13.386
with 100 pennies. 

00:00:13.386 --> 00:00:15.284
Is this enough money? 

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.89
Since 1 penny is equal to 1 cent, 

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:23.201
100 pennies is equal to 100 cents.  

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:27.538
And 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar.  

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.693
So the customer has enough money for the cup of lemonade.  

00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:35.481
Elias has another customer that orders a cup of lemonade.  

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:39.505
His next customer pays for the lemonade with a dollar bill.  

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.581
The easiest way to pay a dollar is with a one dollar bill.  

00:00:43.582 --> 00:00:46.247
We write one dollar like this... 

00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:48.573
with a dollar sign in the front.  

00:00:48.574 --> 00:00:52.993
The number of dollars comes next. For one dollar, 

00:00:52.993 --> 00:00:55.026
we write the digit 1.  

00:00:55.027 --> 00:00:59.76
Then comes a decimal point separating the ones from the

00:00:59.76 --> 00:01:00.621
decimals, 

00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:03.117
or the bills from the cents. 

00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:03.203
 

00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:07.809
And the amount of extra cents come after the decimal point. 

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:11.877
For exactly one dollar, there are zero extra cents.  

00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:14.595
Another friends wants a cup of lemonade, too.  

00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:18.122
This customer wants to pay with 4 quarters.
